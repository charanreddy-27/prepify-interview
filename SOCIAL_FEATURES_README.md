# Social Media Features Implementation

This document describes the implementation of persistent data storage for social media features in the Prepify application.

## Overview

The social media features have been completely refactored to use Firebase Firestore for persistent data storage, ensuring that all user interactions (posts, likes, comments, shares) persist across sessions and are visible to all users.

## Features Implemented

### ✅ Posts Management
- **Create Posts**: Users can create text posts with optional media attachments
- **View Posts**: All posts are displayed in a chronological feed
- **Edit Posts**: Post authors can edit their content (marked as edited)
- **Delete Posts**: Post authors can delete their posts (cascades to related data)
- **Persistent Storage**: All posts persist in Firestore with proper user attribution

### ✅ Likes System
- **Like/Unlike Posts**: Users can like and unlike posts with real-time count updates
- **Persistent Likes**: Like status persists across sessions
- **User-specific State**: Each user sees their own like status
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate feedback with server synchronization

### ✅ Comments System
- **Create Comments**: Users can comment on posts
- **Nested Replies**: Support for replying to comments (one level deep)
- **Comment Likes**: Users can like/unlike comments
- **Edit/Delete Comments**: Comment authors can modify their comments
- **Persistent Storage**: All comments and replies persist with proper threading

### ✅ Shares System
- **Share Posts**: Users can share posts with different share types
- **Share Types**: Direct shares, reposts, and quote shares
- **Persistent Shares**: Share interactions persist across sessions
- **Share Counts**: Real-time share count updates

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

The implementation uses the following Firestore collections:

#### Posts Collection (`posts`)
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  userId: string,
  authorName: string,
  authorRole: string,
  authorAvatar: string | null,
  authorVerified: boolean,
  content: string,
  imageUrl?: string | null,
  videoUrl?: string | null,
  attachmentUrl?: string | null,
  likesCount: number,
  commentsCount: number,
  sharesCount: number,
  isEdited: boolean,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt?: string
}
```

#### Likes Collection (`likes`)
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  postId: string,
  userId: string,
  userName: string,
  createdAt: string
}
```

#### Comments Collection (`comments`)
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  postId: string,
  userId: string,
  authorName: string,
  authorRole: string,
  authorAvatar: string | null,
  authorVerified: boolean,
  content: string,
  parentCommentId: string | null,
  likesCount: number,
  repliesCount: number,
  isEdited: boolean,
  createdAt: string,
  updatedAt?: string
}
```

#### Shares Collection (`shares`)
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  postId: string,
  userId: string,
  userName: string,
  shareType: 'direct' | 'repost' | 'quote',
  quoteContent?: string,
  createdAt: string
}
```

#### Comment Likes Collection (`commentLikes`)
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  commentId: string,
  userId: string,
  userName: string,
  createdAt: string
}
```

### API Endpoints

#### Posts API
- `GET /api/social/posts` - Fetch posts with pagination and filtering
- `POST /api/social/posts` - Create a new post
- `GET /api/social/posts/[id]` - Get a specific post
- `PUT /api/social/posts/[id]` - Update a post
- `DELETE /api/social/posts/[id]` - Delete a post

#### Likes API
- `POST /api/social/likes` - Toggle like on a post

#### Comments API
- `GET /api/social/comments` - Fetch comments for a post
- `POST /api/social/comments` - Create a new comment
- `PUT /api/social/comments/[id]` - Update a comment
- `DELETE /api/social/comments/[id]` - Delete a comment
- `POST /api/social/comments/likes` - Toggle like on a comment

#### Shares API
- `POST /api/social/shares` - Share a post
- `DELETE /api/social/shares` - Unshare a post

### Key Components

#### SocialService (`lib/firebase/social-service.ts`)
- Core database operations
- Handles all CRUD operations for social entities
- Manages data relationships and cascading operations
- Implements proper error handling and validation

#### SocialAPI (`lib/services/social-api.ts`)
- Client-side API wrapper
- Handles HTTP requests to API endpoints
- Provides type-safe methods for all operations
- Manages request/response transformation

#### Social Page (`app/(root)/social/page.tsx`)
- Main social media interface
- Implements optimistic UI updates
- Handles loading states and error management
- Integrates with authentication system

#### CommentsSection (`components/CommentsSection.tsx`)
- Modal component for viewing and managing comments
- Supports nested replies and comment likes
- Real-time comment count updates
- Responsive design with proper accessibility

## Data Persistence Features

### ✅ Cross-Session Persistence
- All user interactions persist after logout/login
- Posts remain visible to all users regardless of author status
- Like states are maintained per user across sessions
- Comments and replies persist with proper threading

### ✅ Real-time Updates
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Server synchronization for data consistency
- Automatic count updates (likes, comments, shares)
- Error handling with rollback on failures

### ✅ Data Integrity
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Cascading deletes for data consistency
- Atomic operations for count updates
- Validation at both client and server levels

### ✅ User Attribution
- All content properly attributed to users
- Author information embedded for performance
- User verification status displayed
- Proper authorization checks for modifications

## Authentication Integration

The social features are fully integrated with the existing Firebase Authentication system:

- User identification through session cookies
- Proper authorization for content modification
- User profile data integration (name, role, avatar)
- Secure API endpoints with authentication middleware

## Performance Optimizations

### Database Optimizations
- Efficient queries with proper indexing
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Embedded user data to reduce joins
- Atomic counter updates for performance

### UI Optimizations
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Lazy loading of comments and replies
- Efficient re-rendering with React state management
- Loading states and skeleton screens

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Schema validation tests
- API client structure validation
- Error handling verification
- Mock data generation helpers

### Integration Tests
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Database persistence validation
- API endpoint functionality
- Data consistency verification

### Manual Testing Script
Run the integration test script to validate all features:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-social-features.ts
```

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Zod schemas for all input validation
- Content length limits and sanitization
- Proper type checking throughout the stack

### Authorization
- User-based content ownership verification
- Secure API endpoints with authentication
- Proper error messages without data leakage

### Data Privacy
- User data properly scoped and protected
- No sensitive information in client responses
- Proper session management integration

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements
- Real-time notifications for interactions
- Advanced content filtering and moderation
- Rich media support (images, videos)
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- User mentions and tagging system
- Content reporting and moderation tools

### Scalability Considerations
- Database sharding strategies for large datasets
- Caching layers for frequently accessed content
- CDN integration for media content
- Background job processing for heavy operations

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following Firebase configuration is properly set:
- `FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`

### Database Rules
Update Firestore security rules to allow proper access to social collections while maintaining security.

### Monitoring
Set up monitoring for:
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error rates and types
- User engagement metrics
